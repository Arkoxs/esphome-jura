## ESPhome - Jura Impressa J6 
This is an ESPhome custom component to communicate with a Jura Impressa J6 coffee machine.  It may also work with other serially-controlled Jura models with minimal adjustment.

It allows monitoring and control via HomeAssistant:

Hardware is a Wemos D1 Mini connected to the 7-pin Jura service port via a 3.3V<->5V logic level converter.\
The D1 mini is powered from the Jura.

If you have diffuculty, try swapping the TX/RX pins.

The D1 Mini and level converter are placed in an enclosure screwed to the back of the Jura, hidden out of the way.

Internal connections to the service connector wires are done with "T" tap/splices, leaving the connector itself alone.
